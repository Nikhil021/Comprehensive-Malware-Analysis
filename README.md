## Executive Summary

A comprehensive malware analysis to unveil the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of a sophisticated malware specimen. This executive summary encapsulates the findings and proposes actionable mitigations to safeguard our assets.

The investigation has unearthed a multifaceted malware, leveraging both basic and advanced techniques for infiltration, persistence, and execution. The malware employs a blend of static and dynamic analysis evasion techniques, intricate encoding schemes, and advanced cryptographic methods to conceal its presence and intentions. Notably, it manipulates system processes, engages in network communication with command-and-control (C2) servers, and exhibits potential for data exfiltration and system compromise.

### Key Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Suspicious strings and DLL dependencies indicating malware capabilities (e.g., HttpSendRequestA, WININET.dll).
- Malicious file creation and persistence mechanisms (e.g., "evxouxu.exe" in startup programs).
- Network communication with suspicious domains (e.g., adobe-dns-3-adobe.com) using hardcoded IPs.
- Process injection and manipulation techniques targeting system processes like "svchost.exe".
- Use of advanced encoding and cryptographic functions to obfuscate data and commands.
- Execution of a command-and-control communication protocol to retrieve operational commands and exfiltrate data.
- Injection of malicious code into legitimate system processes to evade detection and maintain persistence.

### Mitigations and Preventive Measures
- Implementing stringent network monitoring of packets and filtering to block known malicious IPs and domains.
- Enhancing endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities to identify and respond to suspicious process behavior and file modifications.
- Updating antivirus signatures and employing advanced threat detection tools that can identify obfuscation and evasion techniques.
- Conducting routine security awareness training for employees to recognize phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics.
- Deploying application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized applications from executing in sensitive environments.
- Encouraging strong cybersecurity hygiene, including regular software updates and patches to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

- Interesting Strings:  
  - `&\"viur\"`
  - `gKJPAJP\tp]TA`
  - `ETTHMGEPMKJ\vKGPAP\tWPVAEI`
  - `CreateMutexA`
  - `wsprintfA`
  - `HttpSendRequestA`
  - `WININET.dll`
  - `CRYPT32.dll`
  - `<requestedExecutionLevel level='asInvoker' uiAccess='false' />`

#### Dynamic Analysis
Tools Used: PE Explorer, PE Monitor, Autoruns.exe, Fakenet.exe

- The original file runs a child process named `svchost.exe` with PID: 5800.
- Multiple DLLs were created, mapped, and queried such as `ntdl.dll`, `imm32.dll`, `IPHLPAPI.dll`.
- An executable file `evxouxu.exe` was created and placed in startup programs.
- Multiple URLs were accessed with domain name `http:///adobe-dns-3-adobe.com/*` using IPs `192.168.88.128`, `192.0.2.123`.
- The IP `192.168.88.128` is used by `svchost.exe` to establish communication for Windows requests.

### Advanced Analysis

#### Function Analysis
- `sub_4023A3`: Retrieves network adapter info and computer details, encoding them using XOR.
- `sub_402E56`: Acts as a wrapper for initiating encoding/decoding processes.
- `sub_402DF2`: Core function for encoding or decoding data using XOR-based transformation.
- `wsprintfA`: Writes formatted data to a specified string, involving XOR'ed data.
- `sub_401737`: Performs cryptographic operations including key generation, export, and destruction.
- `sub_4018D1`: Creates a new process using a command line string, setting various process attributes.
- `sub_401235`: Masks actions by associating operations with legitimate processes, involves process creation, memory allocation, and code injection.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the complexity and sophistication of modern malware, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and continuous vigilance. Implementing the proposed mitigations and preventive measures can significantly enhance the security posture against such threats.
